title: ModSecurity + malware scans
---

mod_security is enabled when ClamAV malware scanning is enabled. This can be checked and toggled using the *system.virus-scanner* [Scope](Scopes.md).

```bash
# If false, malware scanning is disabled
cpcmd scope:get system.virus-scanner
# Enable malware scanning
cpcmd scope:set system.virus-scanner clamav
# Likewise, to disable it
cpcmd scope:set system.virus-scanner false
```

## Testing

An [EICAR test](https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950) file may be used to evaluate whether mod_security is setup correctly. 

::: tip
It may be necessary to disable anti-virus software briefly to download the test file. EICAR is a universal test for anti-virus software. If AV is working correctly, then EICAR will be deleted/quarantined once it's downloaded onto your machine.
:::

Create a test HTML file named "test-upload.html", which accepts a form upload. Place this file in `/var/www/html`:

```bash
cat > /var/www/html/test-upload.html <<- EOF
<! DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<form action="test-upload.html" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="file" name="file" id="fileToUpload">
<input type="submit" value="Upload Test" name="submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>
EOF
```

Next access https://\<SERVER IP>/test-upload.html and upload the EICAR text file. If mod_security is working as intended, it will return a "406 Not Acceptable" status code. Alternatively you may test it via cURL too:

```bash
echo 'K5B!C%@NC[4\CMK54(C^)7PP)7}$RVPNE-FGNAQNEQ-NAGVIVEHF-GRFG-SVYR!$U+U*' | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]' | curl -F 'file=@-' http://<SERVER IP>/test-upload.html
```

::: details
EICAR characters are transliterated using ROT-13 to avoid detection by anti-virus software, otherwise submission is identical to desktop submission.

Additional logging evidence will be present in /var/log/messages and /var/log/httpd.

```

### Lua testing

Testing from a HTML upload applet is sufficient for most situations; however, additional testing may be done to isolate the Lua/ClamAV segment. Apache <=> mod_security <=> Lua <=> ClamAV. Create a m.log() method for interoperability.

Call `lua` passing off the runAV.lua script to it:

```bash
lua  -i /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d/runAV.lua
```

Then create a stub logger to evaluate the file /eicar with an EICAR signature:

```lua
m = {}
function m:log(log)
    print(log)
end
print(main('/eicar'))
```

Confirmation will be similar, reporting the virus found.

## Whitelisting

Signatures may be whitelisted using `virus-scanner.signature-whitelist` [Scope](./Scopes.md). Each signature is normalized into a format understood by ClamAV. For example to whitelist `{HEX}EICAR.TEST.3.UNOFFICIAL(44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f:68)` from the above example:

```bash
cpcmd scope:set virus-scanner.signature-whitelist '{HEX}EICAR.TEST.3.UNOFFICIAL(44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f:68)'
```

Internally the signature will be saved as `{HEX}EICAR.TEST.3` to `/var/lib/clamav/custom-whitelist.ign2`. Whitelisted signatures can be retrieved using the complementary method, `get`.

```bash
cpcmd scope:get virus-scanner.signature-whitelist
```

## Marker bypass

**New in 3.2.26**

A marker is a special environment variable that instructs ModSecurity to bypass malware filter. An optional marker value may be specified as a secret to prevent a client from purposefully defeating malware protection.

```bash
# Allow bypass marker usage
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstrapper modsec_clamav_marker True
# Update HTTP configuration
upcp -sb apache/modsecurity
```

| Marker Value         | Purpose                                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| True                 | Enable marker usage                    |
| False                | Disable marker usage                   |
| *alphanumeric value* | Requires .htaccess to match this value |

For example, if `modsec_clamav_marker` is `acba3trCZ`, then the following [.htaccess](https://kb.apiscp.com/guides/htaccess-guide/) line would allow a client to bypass scanning:

```
SetEnv BYPASS_SCAN acba3trCZ
```

Likewise the server secret would be set with,

```bash
# Allow bypass marker usage
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstrapper modsec_clamav_marker acba3trCZ
# Update HTTP configuration
upcp -sb apache/modsecurity
```

This allows for periodic rotation of upload protection keys. 

## Remote anti-virus

When multiple servers exist in a cluster, it's beneficial to designate one server ClamAV duties. Such an arrangement is easy to accomplish.

::: warning DoS risks
Use `cpcmd rampart:whitelist CLIENT.IP.ADD.RESS` to whitelist each client IP on the ClamAV scanner. There is no protection against malicious usage resulting in information disclosure or denial of service attacks. There is absolutely **zero authentication**. Firewall authorization is the only safety.

You have been warned. See also [ClamAV's official bulletin](https://blog.clamav.net/2016/06/regarding-use-of-clamav-daemons-tcp.html).
:::

Assuming 1.2.2.1 is the ClamAV scanner and 1.2.2.3 is a participating node using 1.2.2.1 to scan malware:

*On host, 1.2.2.1*:

```bash
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstrapper clamav_clamd_tcp_addr 1.2.2.1
upcp -sb clamav/setup
# Allow communication from 1.2.2.3 to bypass firewall
cpcmd rampart:whitelist 1.2.2.3
```

*On client, 1.2.2.3*
```
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstrapper clamav_clamd_tcp_addr 1.2.2.1
# Setting true implicitly sets clamav_clamd_local_socket to null
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstrapper clamav_client_only true
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstrapper clamav_enabled true
upcp -sb clamav/setup
```

Then perform an EICAR test on client to confirm communication,

```bash
echo 'K5B!C%@NC[4\CMK54(C^)7PP)7}$RVPNE-FGNAQNEQ-NAGVIVEHF-GRFG-SVYR!$U+U*' | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]' > /eicar
clamdscan /eicar
rm -f /eicar
```

## Troubleshooting

### 406 Not Acceptable on POST
ClamAV has determined the file to contain potential malware. Run the file through [VirusTotal.com](https://virustotal.com) first to confirm the file does not contain malware and this is a false positive. The signature may be whitelisted following the "[Whitelisting](#whitelisting)" section above.

### 413 Request Entity Too Large on POST
When sending a large payload (> 256 KB) as a POST, mod_security will reject the content with a `413 Request Entity Too Large` response. This occurs from a combination of the request size and form encoding type ("enctype"). When submitting files, the form enctype should be set as "*multipart/form-data*". A form default encoding type is "*application/x-www-form-urlencoded*" and unsuitable for sending large files ([RFC 1867](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1867) ยง 3.2). Moreover, specifying "*multipart/form-data*" allows a file to suggest its MIME disposition and character encoding ([RFC 2388](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388) ยง 5.6).

mod_security sets a POST limit of 256 KB. This may be raised using Bootstrapper. Size is in bytes. The following example sets the limit to 4 MB using builtin arithmetic in bash.

```bash
cpcmd scope:set cp.bootstrapper modsec_limit_nofiles $((4*1024*1024))
upcp -sb apache/modsecurity
```

A preferred workaround is to correct the form by specifying `enctype="multipart/form-data"` for the offending code as this is the correct way to submit large files and binary data.

### Slow upload

Each file created by the web server is scanned with ClamAV when enabled. Uploading a multitude of files, such as during a WordPress site import using a plugin, will result in extended processing times. Bypassing scans using a [marker](#marker-bypass) is recommended for short-term usage.
